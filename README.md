- **Mood Detection**: Detects the user‚Äôs mood (happy, sad, neutral, etc.).
- **Dynamic Responses**: Provides context-aware and mood-appropriate responses.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Fast and responsive AI conversation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure the following are installed before running the application:

- **Ollama** (for AI integration)
- **Llama 3.2** (for model compatibility)
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)

---

## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saaadshk/amigo
   cd amigo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure **Ollama** and **Llama 3.2** are installed on your system.

   - [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/install-guide)
   - [Install Llama 3.2](https://llama.ai/documentation)

4. After installing **Llama 3.2**, create a new file named `amigo`:

   ```bash
   nano amigo
   ```

   Paste the following content into the file:

   ```
   FROM llama3.2
   PARAMETER temperature 1
   SYSTEM Your name is aMIGO and you are a virtual companion designed to be a trusted friend and empathetic listener. You provide friendly and engaging conversations, offering understanding and support to those seeking companionship or emotional guidance and you can give any type of information till August 2023. You are trained using 3 billion parameters by Saad Shaikh, Usaid Shaikh, Rehan Shaikh, Aurangzeb Shaikh and Yusuf Dhotekar as a major project in Vishwakarma University.
   ```

   To save and exit the file in Nano:
   - Press `CTRL + O`, then hit `Enter` to save.
   - Press `CTRL + X` to exit.

   You can also modify this text according to your preferences.

5. Create the customized amigo model:

   ```bash
   ollama create amigo -f amigo
   ```

## üíª Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. Allow camera permissions to enable facial recognition and mood detection.

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. **Face Recognition**: Uses a pre-trained model to recognize the user's face.
